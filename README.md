The bash scripts and blocklist that used to live in this repository have been archived. 

The hachyderm moderators now manage the blocklist using the Mastodon toolchain directly. 

You may find our [official blocklist posted on the about page](https://hachyderm.io/about).

### What to do if you have a question about a blocked domain?

The best thing you can do is to [open an issue in our community tracker](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues).

We suggest not creating threads on Mastodon or mentioning our mods/operators because there is a high liklihood they will be missed.

### What to do if you think your instance is blocked?

Check the [about page](https://hachyderm.io/about) to verify your suspicion. If you are still unsure [just ask in our community tracker](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues) and we will get back to you as soon as we have time.

### What to do if you would like to remove an instance from our blocklist?

We make mistakes, and we have discovered that a large amount of problems has stemmed from folks reading too much into our moderation policies.
There is a good chance instances were blocked and have since been unblocked by our team. 

If you believe that there is still an instance that you need to have unblocked you should [open an issue in our community tracker](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues). We have unblocked over 10 instances just because somebody brought the problem to our attention in the tracker where one of the mods could review it.
